        <h3>How To Make Lasagna</h3>
        <p>
            In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the best lasagna recipe.<br> 
            She tested several, and finally found her ideal in a mash-up of recipes from Giuliano Bugialli<br> 
            and Elodia Rigante, both Italian cookbook authors.

            “If there were central casting for casseroles, this one deserved the leading role. But its beauty<br> 
            was more than cheese deep. This was the best lasagna I had ever eaten. The sauce was<br> 
            intensely flavored, the cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, the meat was<br> 
            just chunky enough, and the noodles put up no resistance to the fork. Most important, the<br> 
            balance of pasta and sauce was positively Italian. At last I could understand why my neighbor Geoff had told me, as I dragged home more bags in our elevator, that all-day lasagna is the only<br> 
            kind worth making.”
