        <h2>Description</h2> 
            <p>
                You may have memorized the foolproof gem on the back of the Toll House bag, given to the world by Ruth<br> 
                Graves Wakefield in the 1930s. But this may become your new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It’s<br> 
                a little more complicated, and you’ll have to plan ahead: After assembling the dough, you must chill it for at<br> 
                least 24 hours before baking it, and preferably up to 36. This allows the dry ingredients time to soak up the<br> 
                wet ones, which results in a firmer dough. It leads to a marvelously chewy, chocolate-rich cookie. Don’t skimp<br> 
                on good chocolate, and the sea salt is not an option — it’s the beacon at the top of this gorgeous treat. You<br> 
                can certainly put this recipe together by hand, but a stand mixer makes it easy work.

        <h2>Preperation</h2>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Set aside. 
                </p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5<br> 
                    minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to<br> 
                    low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Drop chocolate pieces in and<br> 
                    incorporate them without breaking them. Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36<br> 
                    hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.
                </p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>
                    When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a<br> 
                    nonstick baking mat. Set aside.
                </p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>
                    Scoop 6 3½-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to<br> 
                    turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie.<br> 
                    Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer sheet<br> 
                    to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more. Repeat with<br> 
                    remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day. Eat<br> 
                    warm, with a big napkin.
