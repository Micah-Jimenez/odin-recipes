        <h2>Description</h2> 
            <p>
                You may have memorized the foolproof gem on the back of the Toll House bag, given to the world by Ruth<br> 
                Graves Wakefield in the 1930s. But this may become your new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It’s<br> 
                a little more complicated, and you’ll have to plan ahead: After assembling the dough, you must chill it for at<br> 
                least 24 hours before baking it, and preferably up to 36. This allows the dry ingredients time to soak up the<br> 
                wet ones, which results in a firmer dough. It leads to a marvelously chewy, chocolate-rich cookie. Don’t skimp<br> 
                on good chocolate, and the sea salt is not an option — it’s the beacon at the top of this gorgeous treat. You<br> 
                can certainly put this recipe together by hand, but a stand mixer makes it easy work.
