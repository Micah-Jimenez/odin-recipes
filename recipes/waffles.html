            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>
                    It's time to put that waffle iron languishing in the back of your cabinet to good use. These airy, delicate and<br> 
                    crisp-edged waffles are so fabulous, yet so simple to throw together, they're destined to become part of your<br> 
                    weekend breakfast routine. Freeze leftovers, if you have any, in Ziplock bags and serve them during the week.<br> 
                    You can pop them in the toaster to reheat (use a light setting) and they come out nearly as well as freshly<br> 
                    made, maybe even slightly crunchier.

                <p>
                    For a lighter, fluffier waffle, separate the eggs and proceed with step 2 using the egg yolks. Beat the whites<br> 
                    until stiff, then fold into the batter. For whole-grain waffles, use 1⅓ cup all-purpose flour and ⅔ cup whole-<br>
                    wheat flour. You can also substitute brown sugar for the granulated.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, more for waffle iron
                    </li>
                    <li>2 cups/240 grams all-purpose flour
                    </li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon/15 grams sugar
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon/5 grams fine sea salt
                    </li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon/3 grams baking soda
                    </li>
                    <li>1 cup plain yogurt (or see note)
                    </li>
                    <li>1 cup milk
                    </li>
                    <li>4 large eggs
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Preperation</h2>

                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <p>
                        Melt butter either on the stove or in the microwave. Set aside.  
                    </p>

                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>
                    In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a separate bowl,<br> 
                    whisk together yogurt, milk, melted butter, and eggs. Fold wet ingredients into dry ingredients. 
                </p>

                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>
                    Preheat a waffle iron and, using a pastry brush or paper towel, lightly coat with butter. Cook waffles<br> 
                    (using about ½ cup batter per waffle) until golden and crisp. Butter the iron in between batches as<br> 
                    needed. Serve waffles immediately as they are ready, or keep them warm in a 200 degree oven until<br> 
                    ready to serve.
