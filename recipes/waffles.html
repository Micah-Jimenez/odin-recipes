        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>
                It's time to put that waffle iron languishing in the back of your cabinet to good use. These airy, delicate and<br> 
                crisp-edged waffles are so fabulous, yet so simple to throw together, they're destined to become part of your<br> 
                weekend breakfast routine. Freeze leftovers, if you have any, in Ziplock bags and serve them during the week.<br> 
                You can pop them in the toaster to reheat (use a light setting) and they come out nearly as well as freshly<br> 
                made, maybe even slightly crunchier.

                For a lighter, fluffier waffle, separate the eggs and proceed with step 2 using the egg yolks. Beat the whites<br> 
                until stiff, then fold into the batter. For whole-grain waffles, use 1⅓ cup all-purpose flour and ⅔ cup whole-<br>
                wheat flour. You can also substitute brown sugar for the granulated.
